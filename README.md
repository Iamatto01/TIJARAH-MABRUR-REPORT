Overview

For our CSCI 2304 Intelligent Systems group project, we have chosen the topic “Qur’anic Verse Detection using AI”. The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent system that can identify
the Qur’anic verses from input images. This system can be particularly beneficial for educational, spiritual, and research purposes by helping users quickly recognize and verify
Qur’anic content from various sources. We also will provide a suggestion section to improve our project. If users want to suggest any
ideas such as Qur’anic verse detection through text or audio, they can go to the suggestion section. This project allows us to apply AI ethically and meaningfully in the context of Islamic
knowledge preservation, while also achieving the course objectives of implementing and deploying an AI solution using Python.
